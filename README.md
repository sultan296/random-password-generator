# random-password-generator

You'll see how I structured the page to where visitors can click a button to generate strong, secure passwords featuring uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
I start by setting up the HTML file, where I define the essential layout, including input fields and buttons. Next, I enhance the visual appeal through a stylish CSS design that provides a simple look to the page. 

The core functionality lies in the JavaScript code, which I meticulously crafted to generate a new random password each time the button is clicked. Additionally, I integrated a copy feature that allows users to easily copy the generated password and paste it wherever needed.
